Very useful small class to perform vector calculations. Very practical as basis for all kinds of simulations and games where objects move through a two-dimensional space.

## Get started

import { Vector } from 'vector2d';

const myVector = new Vector(10, 20);

myVector.add(100);
…

const newVector = Vector.add(myVector, 10);
