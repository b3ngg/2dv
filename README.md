Very useful small class to perform vector calculations. Very practical as basis for all kinds of simulations and games where objects move through a two-dimensional space.

## Get started

```
npm i 2dv
```

Use in your JavaScript/Typescript project

```js
import { Vector } from '2dv';
// OR
const Vector = require('2dv);

const myVector = new Vector(10, 20);

myVector.add(100);
…

const newVector = Vector.add(myVector, 10);
…
